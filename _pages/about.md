<span style="font-family: 'Your Font', sans-serif;">I am currently a Computer Science M.Sc. student in the Computer Vision and Robotics Laboratory ([VeRLab](https://www.verlab.dcc.ufmg.br/)) under the supervision of Professor Dr. [Douglas G. Macharet](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~doug/site/en/) at the Department of Computer Science ([DCC](https://www.dcc.ufmg.br/)) of the Federal University of Minas Gerais ([UFMG](https://ufmg.br/)) in Brazil. I hold a Diploma in Automation and Control Engineering from UFMG, obtained in 2023, with one exchange semester at
Hochschule Rhein-Waal ([HSRW](https://www.hochschule-rhein-waal.de/en)), Germany.</span>

<span style="font-family: 'Your Font', sans-serif;">Currently, I am researching socially-aware navigation in mobile manipulators, for my Master's thesis. During my bachelor's I specially worked with path-planning, navigation and cooperation of unmanned aerial and ground vehicles. My main interests lie in autonomous navigation, social robotics, robots cooperation and multi-robot systems.</span>
