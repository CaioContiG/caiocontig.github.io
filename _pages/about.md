<span style="font-family: 'Your Font', sans-serif;">I’m currently an M.Sc. student in the Computer Vision and Robotics Laboratory ([VeRLab](https://www.verlab.dcc.ufmg.br/)) under the supervision of Professor Dr. [Douglas G. Macharet](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~doug/site/en/) at the Department of Computer Science ([DCC](https://www.dcc.ufmg.br/)) of the Federal University of Minas Gerais ([UFMG](https://ufmg.br/)) in Brazil. I graduated in Automation and Control Engineering (Diploma - 5 years) at the same university in 2023 with one exchange semester at
Hochschule Rhein-Waal ([HSRW](https://www.hochschule-rhein-waal.de/en)), Germany. During graduation I worked with drones, multi-robots systems, robots cooperation, routing problems, path planning and evolutionary algorithms.</span>
