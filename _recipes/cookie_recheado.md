## Dough Preparation
1. **Melt the Butter**: Melt the butter and set it aside to cool.
2. **Prepare the Chocolate**: Chop your chocolate bars into pieces as large or small as you like.
3. **Mix Dry Ingredients**:
   - In a medium bowl, whisk together:
     - Flour
     - Cornstarch
     - A pinch of salt
     - A pinch of baking soda  
   *Note: Sifting is not necessary.*
4. **Mix Wet Ingredients**:
   - In a large bowl, whisk together the brown sugar and crystal sugar.
   - Add the melted butter and whisk until combined.
   - Add the egg and egg yolk, whisking until the mixture is homogeneous.
5. **Combine Wet and Dry Ingredients**:
   - Gradually add the dry ingredients from the medium bowl into the large bowl in small portions, whisking.
   - As the dough becomes stiff, switch to a wooden spoon or spatula to mix thoroughly.
6. **Add Chocolate**: Once the mixture is homogeneous, fold in the chopped chocolate.

## Cookie Preparation
1. **Chill the Dough**: Refrigerate the dough for about 30 minutes. This step is essential for molding the cookies.
2. **Portion the Dough**:
   - Divide the dough into portions of 70–100 grams each.
   - Take half of a portion and shape it into a small bowl.
   - Fill the center with strawberry jam. I usually put one (generous) teaspoon. 
   - Cover the filling with the other half of the portion and shape it into a sphere.
3. **Freeze the Cookies**:
   - Place each stuffed cookie sphere in a container lined with plastic wrap to prevent sticking.
   - Work quickly, especially on hot days, to avoid the dough becoming too soft. When one dough is done, put it on the freezer.
   - After shaping all the cookies, freeze them for about 15 minutes to help them hold their shape.
   - Transfer the cookies to a zip-lock bag and freeze overnight if possible.

## Baking the Cookies
- **Preheat Your Oven**: Preheat to 220°C for about 20 minutes. The longer the better, as the cookies will cook faster on the outside, hold their shape better, and maintain a soft inside.
- **Bake from Frozen**: The colder the cookie, the better it will hold its shape while baking.
- **Baking Time**: Bake directly from frozen until the edges are brown and the top is soft-ish. In my oven, this took about 25 minutes, but it will vary depending on your oven.

### Additional Tips:
- **Spacing**: Leave enough space between the cookies to prevent them from sticking together.
- **Parchment Paper**: Use parchment paper to line your baking pan. There's no need to grease it, as the cookies have plenty of butter and likely won't stick. 
  - The parchment paper is optional, but without it the cookies might cook more on the bottom and remain a bit undercooked on the top.
- **Jam Stickiness**: While the dough usually won't stick, jam spilling onto the pan may cause slight sticking.

### Extra observations:
I tried filling with doce de leite, jabuticaba jam and caramel, but I couldn't make it work, there is probably a way tho. You can also add nuts in the dough with the chocolate chips if you like it.

Enjoy your soft, jam-filled cookies!
